                                Hey, my name is <strong>Alan Chen</strong> (he/his/him), a freshman studying at Brown University. I am double majoring in Computer Science and Applied Math while dabbling in other areas.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My primary current interests are artificial intelligence/machine learning, algorithms and theoretical computer science including cryptography, FinTech (crypto, NFTs, investing, etc.), and combinatorics/probability/statistics theory. I truly believe CS is the future of the world and is a tool that can be applied in infinite contexts.   
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I want to share my work, projects, thoughts, knowledge, and concerns with the world. Above all, I want to change the world for the benefit of others. 
                                
                            </p>
                            <p>Some random facts about me:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Winter is my favorite season.</li>
                                <li>My favorite activites include swimming, coding, studying math/CS theory, watching anime, reading (esp. personal growth books), playing video games, video editing, and listening to/playing music.</li>
                                <li>I'm currently taking 5 classes: an intro CS class, Differential Equations, Statistical Inference, Linear Algebra, and Intro to Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                I hope you enjoy your stay. Feel free (in fact, please) contact/find me in any of the following ways:
                            </p>
