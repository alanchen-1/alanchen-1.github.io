Hi, I'm Alan, a junior studying at Brown University. I'm doing a ScM in Applied Math and a BSc in Computer Science. I currently do research in the [LUNAR Lab](https://lunar.cs.brown.edu/) in LLM interpretability.

My interests are probability and statistical learning theory, AI safety, theoretical computer science, and philosophy.

Some random facts about me:
- My favorite activities include swimming, coding, reading, listening to music, and light anime or video games.
- Winter is my favorite season.
- My dream vacation would be to Iceland/Alaska.

I hope you enjoy your stay :) - Alan
