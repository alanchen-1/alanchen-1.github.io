Hi, I'm Alan Chen, a junior studying at Brown University. I am pursuing a ScM in Applied Math and a BSc in Computer Science.

My interests are probability and statistical learning theory, AI alignment, theoretical computer science, and philosophy.

Some random facts about me:
- My favorite activities include swimming, coding, reading, music, and occasionally some anime or video games.
- Winter is my favorite season.
- My dream vacation would be to Iceland/Alaska.

I recently ported my entire blog to Jekyll. What a pain that was...

I hope you enjoy your stay :) - Alan
