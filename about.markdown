Hey, I'm Alan! I'm currently a researcher at DRW, a market making firm based in Chicago.

I graduated from Brown University with a Master's in Applied Math and Bachelor's in Computer Science. While there, I did research with the [LUNAR Lab](https://lunar.cs.brown.edu/) in LLM interpretability and with Prof. Govind Menon in theoretical deep learning, which are interests I'd like to return to someday.

My general academic interests are in probability and statistics, AI, theoretical computer science, and amateur philosophy.

Otherwise, I love swimming, going to the gym, listening to music, cooking (with high variance results), and watching the Packers choke. When I'm at home, I also like to take pictures of my cat Mimi.
