Hi, I'm Alan. I graduated from Brown University with a Master's in Applied Math and Bachelor's in Computer Science. While there, I did research with the [LUNAR Lab](https://lunar.cs.brown.edu/) in LLM interpretability and with Prof. Govind Menon in theoretical deep learning, which are interests I'd like to return to someday :)

My general academic interests are in probability and statistics, AI, theoretical computer science, and amateur philosophy.

Otherwise, I love swimming, going to the gym, listening to music, cooking (with high variance results), and watching the Packers choke. When I'm at home, I also like to take pictures of my cat Mimi.
