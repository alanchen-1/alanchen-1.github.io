Hi, I'm Alan, a senior at Brown University. I'm doing a ScM in Applied Math and a BSc in Computer Science. I currently do research in the [LUNAR Lab](https://lunar.cs.brown.edu/) in LLM interpretability and with Prof. Govind Menon in theoretical deep learning.

My academic interests are in probability and statistics, AI, theoretical computer science, and amateur philosophy.

Otherwise, I love swimming, going to the gym, listening to music, cooking (with high variance results), and watching the Packers choke. When I'm at home, I also like to take pictures of my cat Mimi.
