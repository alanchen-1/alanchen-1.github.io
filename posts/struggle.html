                                Think back on your most recent struggles, whether it be relationship related, school related, etc. For me, I immediately think of my real analysis class the past semester and how difficult that was, lol. Would you want to go back and do it all again? Of course not, unless you‚Äôre a masochist - most likely you‚Äôre glad it‚Äôs over. Yet, in one of the most well spoken chapters I have ever read in a book, in <i>Mathematics for Human Flourishing</i>, Dr. Francis Su frames struggle as an <i>inherent human desire</i>. Wait, what?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In classic mathematical fashion, Dr. Su‚Äôs argument actually comes down to a matter of definitions. Dr. Su calls the struggles that I asked you to think about in the beginning ‚Äústruggles through suffering.‚Äù They are characterized by pain and grief - thus, it would be insane to call them desirable. Yet, there is another type of struggle - the struggle to grow, drawn from the desire to become better at the things we do.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There is potentially sample bias at play here, but essentially everyone that I‚Äôve met has been chasing <i>something</i>. They had something they wanted to get better at or to learn more about. This is the ubiquity of the struggle to grow - it is a common human experience to struggle and fight to improve.  
                            </p>

                                I worked as a TA this past semester for an intermediate level software engineering course and one of the big takeaways I had was that, unfortunately, ‚Äústruggling‚Äù was not a comfortable state for the vast majority of students to be, even in an environment where it was clear that the intended goal was to improve, grow, and learn. The class was mandatory pass fail and the professor emphasized his desire for students to focus on the mastery of material, which to be honest is pretty revolutionary in terms of college courses and part of an increasing effort of instructors across the nation to address exactly what I will talk about in this post. Yet, I still observed students coming to hours with the sole mentality of resolving all bugs as soon as possible, regardless of the means.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not wanting to be hypocritical, I forced myself to reflect on if struggling was comfortable for me. Why should it be? Who in their right mind would actively enjoy and desire to be in a state of not knowing and not sure how to proceed? Thinking greedily, why would a student ever pursue the more difficult road of attempting to resolve the bug on their own, when they can go to hours and get their bug solved in $\leq 15$ minutes with a TA?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Yet, given some more thought, I truly believe that being in a state of struggle has to be comfortable, especially in computer science and mathematics. In fact, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that struggling is the <i>root of all enjoyment</i> in these two fields. Bluntly, it is impossible to enjoy mathematics and computer science without being comfortable being in a state of perpetual struggle.

                                Let me first delve deeply into those rhetorical questions from a couple paragraphs prior and why I think, as a whole, we are uncomfortable with student‚Äôs struggling. I think it‚Äôs caused by two big issues with mentalities and approaches to learning, one on the instructor side and one on the student side.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> But, most importantly, this deep dive will provide the foundation for why I believe that we can control and fix the mentality. I‚Äôll introduce both problems, their roots, and then discuss how I think we can fix or at least reduce their impacts. But first, a short prelude.

                                Prelude - Fundamentalness
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                I want to start with a brief digression into the <b>fundamentalness</b> of various subjects because it‚Äôs important context for my arguments later. Here‚Äôs a graphical description of how fundamental I think various fields are, with the bottom of the pyramid representing the most fundamental fields and the top being the most high level. Sticking to sciences for simplicity, though I thought I‚Äôd throw computer science in there even though it‚Äôs kind of a bit different than the others.
                            </p>
                            <img src="../assets/struggle images/fundamentalness.png" width="500" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto;">
                            <p>
                                I justify this pyramid in a depth-first approach - begin by proposing a question in the highest level field. Then, inductively ask "why" or ‚Äúhow‚Äù to every subsequent answer - I claim that this pyramid will trace itself out.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, we can begin in biology and ask how some cell system in our body functions. A biologist or premed student will probably tell you some steps that the system loops through each day. Well, how and why does each step work? Okay, now we need to talk about the reactions going on and which enzymes trigger what - we‚Äôve entered the realm of chemistry. Go again - why do these reactions occur? Now it‚Äôs physics‚Äô turn - electrons do this and that, intermolecular + intramolecular forces come into play, etc. How do we know exactly how to analyze these forces and the movement of particles? We‚Äôve reached the bottom level - there exist mathematical laws that govern these behaviors. If we continue the questioning search, there is only more math until eventually you reach the axioms (accepted truths) of the mathematical system that you are working in, such as Euclidean geometry or Peano‚Äôs axioms.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This pyramid is also loosely corroborated by colloquial terminology used by college students, one of the most reliable sources out there üëç. When I hear bio students talk about their exams, I often hear the word ‚Äúquestion‚Äù come up a lot. But, when I hear math students talk about their exams, the word ‚Äúproblem‚Äù appears more often. The distinction lies in the <i>depth</i> of the ideas at play - ‚Äúquestion‚Äù implies a very surface level inquiry, while ‚Äúproblem‚Äù implies the necessity of a deeper understanding and more mature thought process. Neither is better or more difficult than the other, the nature of the fields just necessitates different approaches.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With that out of the way, I‚Äôll start with my discussion of one of the big two causes of the discomfort with struggling.
                            </p>

                                Instructors - The Problematic Fact Based Approach
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The first reason as to why I think struggling, particularly mathematically, is not welcomed is because of the way teaching math is approached.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The way math is introduced at an elementary level is largely memorization based. Remember those multiplication speed tests? How about when the laws of cosines and sines were introduced - how many of us were taught <i>where</i> they came from or <i>why</i> they worked? In calculus, we were taught <i>what</i> a Taylor expansion is, but not <i>why</i> the idea is so important or so beautiful. Sure, some of this can be attributed to the scope of the courses or lack of time before AP tests, but I still think that the intuition and motivation behind the results is of utmost importance to appreciating and consequently enjoying mathematics. Otherwise, we end up with students blindly applying formulas and methods that they don‚Äôt truly understand, only to then be completely bamboozled and flabbergasted when a new problem arises that they haven‚Äôt seen an exact replica of before in class.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thinking about my favorite recent memories of math, a nontrivial amount of them come from looking back on old topics and realizing a sudden deeper understanding of their significance. Going kind of technical for the example here: two semesters ago, one of my professors introduced the following problem. Suppose we have observed samples from some function $f$ applied to a random variable $X$ of unknown distribution. So, for instance, we can calculate observables like $\mathbb{E}[f(x)]$. Knowing this information, what‚Äôs the most <i>unbiased</i> guess for $\mathbb{E}[g(X)]$, where $g$ is some other function? In essence, it‚Äôs asking us what‚Äôs the most <i>unbiased</i> guess for the distribution of $X$? It turns out this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_distribution">Gibbs distribution</a><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, of which he presented some super fast derivation of on the board. He said it with enough confidence and it made enough sense in my head, so I accepted it as fact, but past that I kinda brushed it off and didn‚Äôt think too much about it since he was moving so fast. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But, after taking Information Theory this past semester, I learned that the idea of the ‚Äúbias‚Äù of a distribution can be formulated through entropy, which is a quantity that measures unpredictability. A distribution with low entropy would be one that is very predictable - we can make good guesses as to what samples from that distribution might look like, like a constant random variable. A distribution with high entropy is one that is unpredictable, with the most unpredictable being the uniform distribution, since we can‚Äôt really ‚Äúexploit‚Äù anything about it to guess what samples might look like. 
                                
                                
                            </p>
                            <img src="../assets/struggle images/low_vs_high_entropy.png" width="500" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto;">
                            <p>
                                Thus, in a way, the distribution with maximum entropy has the least ‚Äúbias‚Äù in it. Now, looking back to the course from two semesters ago, I immediately gained a much deeper understanding of that one quick sentence and derivation that my professor did - it comes from the principle of maximum entropy, which essentially formalizes this maximum entropy - least bias relationship. After applying this principle, the derivation of the Gibbs distribution simply reduces to a constrained (since the probabilities of each outcome must sum to 1) multivariate optimization problem that can be solved using Lagrange multipliers, which are introduced in multivariable calculus. Boom. Connections suddenly spawned everywhere - I genuinely said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs so sick‚Äù out loud.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Yet, I feel like despite these experiences consisting a sizable portion of my best memories with math, it‚Äôs extremely rare that an instructor fosters this idea of ‚Äúlooking backward,‚Äù especially at an elementary level but persisting at the university level. It‚Äôs partly out of their control - especially at Brown, course plans are extremely nonlinear for most students and it‚Äôs dangerous to assume a universal knowledge of ideas outside of strictly material discussed in class or official prerequisites (which even then, different instructors across different semesters tend to cover material in different ways).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Like I talked about in my previous <a href="imposter-syndrome.html">post</a>, I believe that people are incapable of appreciating the beauty of or enjoying a field without having first gotten our hands dirty. Yet, by teaching through memorization and without emphasizing connections to previous topics, instructors eliminate the ‚Äúgetting hands dirty‚Äù part. By reducing the field to sheer memorization and disjoint, scattered topics in space, the struggle to grow disappears and is instead replaced with a ‚Äúsuperficial‚Äù struggle to memorize arbitrary terminology and facts. There is no discovery process, seemingly no urge to ask ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù questions, and no overarching connections being built. The heart and soul of mathematics and the key contributors to the struggle to grow in mathematics are being stripped down in favor of a more time efficient but, put plainly, <i>boring</i> education.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I think we can call this approach of memorization-based teaching <b>fact-based teaching</b>. Sorry bio majors - I‚Äôm going to have to come after you a bit here but it‚Äôs not meant to be targeted. Your field is just notorious for this just because it is so high level. Teachers can get away with applying fact-based teaching in the biology department because the density of content is just too much. Actually, I‚Äôd argue that they are even forced into it - the complexities of life‚Äôs processes are so great that any one semester course, no matter how specific you go, will still feel rushed and crammed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But, the problems with fact-based teaching become exacerbated when applied to a more fundamental field, like math. This is intrinsically because of the persistent and recurring appearance of struggles with why and how questions, which are, in a sense, more mature and difficult than the aforementioned ‚Äúsuperficial‚Äù struggles (Okay, it‚Äôs still a struggle to memorize stuff, but I think I‚Äôm trying to say that the struggle lacks the context of a deeper purpose or motivation.). If this struggle is brushed aside in a biology course, it‚Äôs not great but excusable. When it‚Äôs brushed aside in a math course, one might even ask if it‚Äôs even a math course anymore (I‚Äôm looking at you, Brown undergraduate APMA courses), because the students learn from their instructors - if the instructors are applying fact-based approaches to teaching the material, the students will apply fact-based approaches to learning and applying the material, resulting in an overall surface level depth of knowledge being communicated.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Clearly, fact based teaching completely breaks down when the field becomes fundamental enough, yet I would argue that it shouldn‚Äôt even be applied to higher level fields like biology because it doesn‚Äôt work there either. I don‚Äôt know much about neuroscience or how our brain works or what it derives pleasure from, but from my own experience, understanding the material deeply and being able to draw connections between topics, regardless of the subject, is absolutely vital to being able to extrapolate material onto new problems that would be encountered in an exam or research, which is where the <i>human</i> part of learning exists and <i>flourishes</i>. If you want facts to be memorized, a robot can do that better than any human ever can - play with ChatGPT for a bit.
                            </p>

                                But, the ability to synthesize new thoughts and solutions, an ability which is only developed through struggle - that‚Äôs exclusively human, and where we derive the most joy in our practices because it's evidence that we have grown in skill.

                                As mentioned in the very beginning, I agree with Dr. Su on the belief that it is a common human experience to have a desire to grow and improve at something. Dr. Su mentions the work of philosopher Alaisdair MacIntyre, who introduces two ways this growth is visualized - external goods and internal goods.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                External goods are goods that come about by engaging in the practice, but only as accidents of social circumstance and not inherently because of the activity. Because they aren‚Äôt inherent, they can always come about another way.
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                For example, wealth, social status, and grades are all forms of external goods. On the other hand:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                Internal goods are goods that come about by engaging in a practice and are bound up intrinsically with that practice; such goods cannot be had apart from engaging in that or similar practices.

                                Under this definition, examples of internal goods are mastery of a subject, finding joy in an activity, or Dr. Su‚Äôs example of ‚Äústrategic imagination‚Äù in chess.

                                The problem is that most of us live our lives controlled by a desire to achieve external goods - they are along the path of less resistance. Especially in the age of technology, where pleasure can be found easily at the opening of a social media app, it‚Äôs easier than ever to get sucked into believing that external goods are everything. I think I am guilty of this, but looking around at some of the most brilliant friends that I am lucky to know, I am confident that the best of the best are motivated purely by internal goods. They don‚Äôt even care that other people believe they are the best - they are just driven by a desire to every day be better than they were yesterday.

                                How does this relate back to struggling? Well, it‚Äôs often that the path to pursuing internal goods is muddled with struggles, while the path to external goods is much less so. Let‚Äôs go back to the TA example I gave. The path to pursuing internal goods would involve potentially spending multiple hours debugging the same issue, repeatedly Googling and trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on, potentially only to discover that the issue is part of a bigger, scarier issue with the program as a whole. On the other hand, the student can choose to pursue the external good of grades, in which case going to TA hours is the greedy strategy, because a TA can probably help you resolve the bug much faster. Which one does the student learn more from?

                                In particular, this issue is prevalent in mathematics and computer science because, if the problems are chosen as I‚Äôve explained previously, they should be hard. Oftentimes, there is no end in sight and you can sit there basking in your utter inability to do the problem and lack of ideas. My intro CS professor put it that, ‚Äútheoretically, a student could spend all of eternity stuck on debugging a bug in their program or stuck at some step in a proof.‚Äù

                                I‚Äôm not advocating for never going to TA hours, but I am advocating for holding yourself to a higher standard. Even when you are convinced that you can do absolutely nothing and your situation is utterly hopeless, you should <i>still</i> try for a bit longer before going to TA hours. One needs to be able to identify the difference between <i>struggling</i> and <i>completely lost with no hope</i> - the former should be welcomed and embraced, while the latter actually requires help. TA hours should be a last resort instead of a crutch. TAs can also aid in this mental shift by not just handing out free answers in hours, because that plays into the cycle of minimal effort and fast releases from the all-important struggle to grow.

                            <p>
                                I admit these ideas are quite utopian - in reality, TAs are under heavy emotional and physical stress in various courses, dealing with literally hundreds of students in line for hours. At that point, it just becomes an endless spiral downwards - tons of students prematurely go to TA hours with bugs, TAs are swamped and backed into a corner in which the easy way out is to just give out answers instead of creating educational experiences, and then students don‚Äôt learn anything and instead come back the next day with more problems. On the student end, we are also under the pressure of various stressors, including employment, family, and graduate school. But, I still believe that a leap of faith and a small change in mentality can go a long way.

                            <h3>Leap of Faith</h3>
                            <p>
                                To me, it all boils down to a simple shift in perspective - the key leap of faith is believing with every particle in your body that the external goods are just byproducts of the production of internal goods and true, profound learning exclusively occurs through struggle.

                                ‚ÄúBut Alan, I‚Äôm a premed student, I have to care about my grades! Otherwise I can‚Äôt get into medical school!‚Äù <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> As usual, the idea is easy to state but difficult to implement, because it relies on not caring about external goods - even in the previous section I literally just mentioned some reasons why this is extremely difficult for some people! Still, I maintain that it just relies on a leap of faith to truly believe that if you focus on internal goods, the external goods will come for free. Taking the cheap way out to pursue external goods first and immediate relief from struggle will only result in, at best, mediocrity and additional struggles down the road.

                                A direct corollary can be applied to studying for exams. To me, it is crucial to spend a majority of the time doing <b>active studying</b> instead of <b>passive studying</b>. Passive studying involves reading over notes, rewatching lectures, etc. These activities can be partially effective, giving a fake sense of studying and a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being productive‚Äù feeling. On the other hand, I count active forms of studying as anything that directly embraces the struggle - in math, this primarily comes in the form of doing problems. Importantly, they must be hard problems (hard being a relative term).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The reason why I describe passive studying as ‚Äúpartially effective‚Äù is because, no matter how much I express my dislike for fact-based education, the truth is that memorization is probably a more efficient strategy to get better grades. But, I claim that the efficiency comes at a cost. At least for me, that knowledge that I ‚Äúlearned‚Äù and ‚Äúunderstood‚Äù through passive studying leaves my head as soon as the semester ends and just as quickly as I tried to shove it all in. It is the complete opposite when I embrace the struggle - the struggle and what I tried to do to resolve it stick like glue in my brain.

                                Thinking more broadly outside of the scope of purely mathematics, computer science, or academics, when I asked you about the struggles you‚Äôve recently had, I want to emphasize the likely <i>vividness</i> of your recollections. I‚Äôm willing to bet you even remembered specific scenes of particularly difficult moments, like flashbacks to our own little wars - I remember a moment sometime in early December, sitting in my room staring at whatever the heck a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Littlewood_maximal_function">Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Function</a> is with the final exam for real analysis looming right around the corner, and I just had this sinking feeling of ‚ÄúDang. This is so hard man. I got no clue what a $M f(x)$ or an $A_rf(x)$ is bruh. ???‚Äù
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Despite being a different type of struggling, the struggle to grow still maintains this vividness property. Struggles etch into the grooves of our mind, becoming like scars in our memory. Our memories of them decay over time at a rate proportional to the initial magnitude, but they‚Äôre still there. That‚Äôs why I believe they are so vital - <b>we learn and remember the most when we have no clue what‚Äôs going on</b>. Thus, we should actually actively seek to place ourselves in situations where we struggle, a behavior that can only be consistent if it is supported by the mentioned shift in perspective of prioritizing internal goods.

                                I think the most optimistic takeaway from thinking about this topic is that it‚Äôs not hopeless. It's impossible to romanticize struggle - at the end of the day, struggling can and will still be frustrating, annoying, and demotivating. In many cases, even the most valiant of efforts will bear "no visible fruit." But, because we all have control over our own mentalities, I think by choosing the right one we can set ourselves up for success - "it's all mental."
